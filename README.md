# Project 0
# This is a project I wanted to do long time ago, it is a website for an online magazine with real stories of people in Vietnam, it is inspired by Humans of New York. 

First I made the index file to give an introduction of what the project will be, Saigon photo walk as Title.

Then I divide the screen in two sections, header to show the img I made as a logo and after the stories i will write when i get the chance to interview the people.

Then in the Nav bar i have 4 bottons Home, Magazine, Collaborators and contact.

The magazine section I create a monthly sections as the magazine grows I will add more and link it to the according file. 

In collaborators page I add a short text of me and one of my team mate and contact just a table with my email and names.
